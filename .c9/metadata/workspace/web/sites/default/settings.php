Drupal is able to connect\n * to multiple databases, including multiple types of databases,\n * during the same request.\n *\n * Each database connection is specified as an array of settings,\n * similar to the following:\n * @code\n * array(\n *   'driver' => 'mysql',\n *   'database' => 'databasename',\n *   'username' => 'username',\n *   'password' => 'password',\n *   'host' => 'localhost',\n *   'port' => 3306,\n *   'prefix' => 'myprefix_',\n *   'collation' => 'utf8_general_ci',\n * );\n * @endcode\n *\n * The \"driver\" property indicates what Drupal database driver the\n * connection should use.  This is usually the same as the name of the\n * database type, such as mysql or sqlite, but not always.  The other\n * properties will vary depending on the driver.  For SQLite, you must\n * specify a database file name in a directory that is writable by the\n * webserver.  For most other drivers, you must specify a\n * username, password, host, and database name.\n *\n * Transaction support is enabled by default for all drivers that support it,\n * including MySQL. To explicitly disable it, set the 'transactions' key to\n * FALSE.\n * Note that some configurations of MySQL, such as the MyISAM engine, don't\n * support it and will proceed silently even if enabled. If you experience\n * transaction related crashes with such configuration, set the 'transactions'\n * key to FALSE.\n *\n * For each database, you may optionally specify multiple \"target\" databases.\n * A target database allows Drupal to try to send certain queries to a\n * different database if it can but fall back to the default connection if not.\n * That is useful for master/slave replication, as Drupal may try to connect\n * to a slave server when appropriate and if one is not available will simply\n * fall back to the single master server.\n *\n * The general format for the $databases array is as follows:\n * @code\n * $databases['default']['default'] = $info_array;\n * $databases['default']['slave'][] = $info_array;\n * $databases['default']['slave'][] = $info_array;\n * $databases['extra']['default'] = $info_array;\n * @endcode\n *\n * In the above example, $info_array is an array of settings described above.\n * The first line sets a \"default\" database that has one master database\n * (the second level default).  The second and third lines create an array\n * of potential slave databases.  Drupal will select one at random for a given\n * request as needed.  The fourth line creates a new database with a name of\n * \"extra\".\n *\n * For a single database configuration, the following is sufficient:\n * @code\n * $databases['default']['default'] = array(\n *   'driver' => 'mysql',\n *   'database' => 'databasename',\n *   'username' => 'username',\n *   'password' => 'password',\n *   'host' => 'localhost',\n *   'prefix' => 'main_',\n *   'collation' => 'utf8_general_ci',\n * );\n * @endcode\n *\n * For handling full UTF-8 in MySQL, including multi-byte characters such as\n * emojis, Asian symbols, and mathematical symbols, you may set the collation\n * and charset to \"utf8mb4\" prior to running install.php:\n * @code\n * $databases['default']['default'] = array(\n *   'driver' => 'mysql',\n *   'database' => 'databasename',\n *   'username' => 'username',\n *   'password' => 'password',\n *   'host' => 'localhost',\n *   'charset' => 'utf8mb4',\n *   'collation' => 'utf8mb4_general_ci',\n * );\n * @endcode\n * When using this setting on an existing installation, ensure that all existing\n * tables have been converted to the utf8mb4 charset, for example by using the\n * utf8mb4_convert contributed project available at\n * https://www.drupal.org/project/utf8mb4_convert, so as to prevent mixing data\n * with different charsets.\n * Note this should only be used when all of the following conditions are met:\n * - In order to allow for large indexes, MySQL must be set up with the\n *   following my.cnf settings:\n *     [mysqld]\n *     innodb_large_prefix=true\n *     innodb_file_format=barracuda\n *     innodb_file_per_table=true\n *   These settings are available as of MySQL 5.5.14, and are defaults in\n *   MySQL 5.7.7 and up.\n * - The PHP MySQL driver must support the utf8mb4 charset (libmysqlclient\n *   5.5.3 and up, as well as mysqlnd 5.0.9 and up).\n * - The MySQL server must support the utf8mb4 charset (5.5.3 and up).\n *\n * You can optionally set prefixes for some or all database table names\n * by using the 'prefix' setting. If a prefix is specified, the table\n * name will be prepended with its value. Be sure to use valid database\n * characters only, usually alphanumeric and underscore. If no prefixes\n * are desired, leave it as an empty string ''.\n *\n * To have all database names prefixed, set 'prefix' as a string:\n * @code\n *   'prefix' => 'main_',\n * @endcode\n * To provide prefixes for specific tables, set 'prefix' as an array.\n * The array's keys are the table names and the values are the prefixes.\n * The 'default' element is mandatory and holds the prefix for any tables\n * not specified elsewhere in the array. Example:\n * @code\n *   'prefix' => array(\n *     'default'   => 'main_',\n *     'users'     => 'shared_',\n *     'sessions'  => 'shared_',\n *     'role'      => 'shared_',\n *     'authmap'   => 'shared_',\n *   ),\n * @endcode\n * You can also use a reference to a schema/database as a prefix. This may be\n * useful if your Drupal installation exists in a schema that is not the default\n * or you want to access several databases from the same code base at the same\n * time.\n * Example:\n * @code\n *   'prefix' => array(\n *     'default'   => 'main.',\n *     'users'     => 'shared.',\n *     'sessions'  => 'shared.',\n *     'role'      => 'shared.',\n *     'authmap'   => 'shared.',\n *   );\n * @endcode\n * NOTE: MySQL and SQLite's definition of a schema is a database.\n *\n * Advanced users can add or override initial commands to execute when\n * connecting to the database server, as well as PDO connection settings. For\n * example, to enable MySQL SELECT queries to exceed the max_join_size system\n * variable, and to reduce the database connection timeout to 5 seconds:\n *\n * @code\n * $databases['default']['default'] = array(\n *   'init_commands' => array(\n *     'big_selects' => 'SET SQL_BIG_SELECTS=1',\n *   ),\n *   'pdo' => array(\n *     PDO::ATTR_TIMEOUT => 5,\n *   ),\n * );\n * @endcode\n *\n * WARNING: These defaults are designed for database portability.
